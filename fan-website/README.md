## Briefing
There is no imposed layout but nothing prevents you from taking over that of site A.

Make a website on a character of your choice (TV series, movie, video game, ...). The best is that this character is cross-media (eg Batman is present in movies, series, video games, comics, ...) for the part "presentation". Try to choose a character that is in at least two media.

Minimum 5 pages with:

- **Presentation**
- **Biography**
- **Photographs** (Photo Gallery of the characters),
- **Goodies** (Derivatives purchase simulation page),
- **Contact** (I do not make you a drawing)

**NOT OBLIGATORY BONUS**: Instead of 5 pages, make 5 tabs and make this site on one web page.

## Presentation
The special feature of this page is that it will contain a submenu with tabs. One tab per medium in which the character appears. (minimum two tabs). To borrow Batman's example, you could make a tab [Batman 1989] and briefly talk about Batman in this movie and then another tab [Gotham] and briefly talk about Batman in this series. If you are not inspired for the content, you can use wikipedia text but MENTION YOUR SOURCES! (at least in the readme.md which will be obviously in the repo of your project).

## Biography
It will be necessary that the life of the personage is "chapter" (example: "childhood, adolescence, adult life, end of life" OR "season 1, season 2, ..."). We will have to click on the title of the chapter to unwind the text. This will prevent spoilers. (for example with a toggle method with maybe a speed parameter)

## Gallery
Make a photo gallery of the character. Use jQuery to make it pretty. A carousel, a lighbox, ... Make the code yourself or use a plugin, do whatever you want.

## Goodies
A page with a list of derivatives with the amount per piece, a field for the user to indicate how many items he wants to buy. By clicking the [Preview Before Purchase] button, the user sees the total of his purchase. The display is done either in a pop-up (alert) or in the HTML page (plan a location for the display). BONUS: If the amount is less than 15 €, the user will have to pay 10 € delivery costs. If the amount is between € 16 and € 30, the fee is only € 7. If the amount of the order is more than 31 €, shipping costs are free.

## Contact
Make a contact form that will verify that all the fields are filled. If the fields are empty, give them a background of color to highlight them and indicate below **Advice**

Make the HTML first, put the content in it, then write the necessary scripts.
Do not forget:
correctly encode your HTML (titles with h1, h2, paragraphs in p tags ...). A well organized code and always easier to process.
correctly name your IDs. Use names that make sense, easy to locate on your page.
